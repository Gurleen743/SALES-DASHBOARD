**Mumbai has the highest sales**
•	Mumbai leads with sales of 8,406,109, making it the most profitable market among the four cities. The city likely benefits from its large population, robust infrastructure, and higher purchasing power. Additionally, it may have a well-established distribution network and a targeted marketing strategy.

**Sales comparison between Mumbai and Bangalore**
•	Mumbai’s sales are 1,380,845 higher than Bangalore’s total sales of 10,252,64. This significant gap may result from Mumbai's larger consumer base or better sales execution.
•	Tapping into Bangalore’s Potential: Bangalore, being a tech hub, has room for growth. Strengthening regional campaigns and leveraging the city's tech-savvy population could bridge the sales gap.
**Cochin and Delhi’s zero sales**

•	Krish emerges as the top performer with sales of 6,000,694, demonstrating exceptional skills in client acquisition and retention. His contribution likely stems from serving high-sales regions such as Mumbai.
•	Leveraging Top Performers: Krish’s methods should be analyzed and used to mentor other team members for consistent growth.
**Comparison of Kate and Asif**
•	Asif’s sales of 5,760,896 are slightly higher than Kate’s 5,549,441, a difference of 216,455. This marginal lead could be due to better understanding of customer needs or access to more lucrative territories.

**Aryan’s lowest performance**
•	Aryan ranks lowest with 5,077,555, trailing Krish by 923,139. This performance gap might indicate a lack of resources, inefficient processes, or challenges in managing client relationships.
